# AI and Machine Learning for Middle School

This project is an interactive course designed to introduce middle school students to artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts. The course is structured to be engaging, age-appropriate, and educational, with a focus on hands-on learning and visual explanations.

## Course Overview

The course consists of six modules:

1. **Introduction to AI**: Learn what AI is, how it's different from regular computer programs, and where you encounter it in daily life.
2. **How Machines Learn**: Discover how machines learn from data and how this differs from traditional programming.
3. **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**: Explore different approaches to machine learning and how they're used to solve problems.
4. **Large Language Models and Attention Mechanisms**: Understand how AI processes language and the technology behind chatbots and virtual assistants.
5. **AI Ethics and Responsibility**: Learn about the ethical considerations and responsibilities when developing and using AI.
6. **Creating with AI**: Discover how AI can be used as a creative tool and explore the future of AI technology.
